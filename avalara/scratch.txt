# 1GB MeM
# Read a file with 10GB with randon numbers per line

# Input: file path containing the file with the randon numbers
# Output: file path with the sorted numbers


func readFile(string FilePath) string FilePath {
    check := chucker(FilePath, 10, 1GB)


}

step 1: divide the file in 10 chuncks
step 2: sort individual chuncks
step 3: interate over the chunks sorted and append into the output file

1: 1,2,3
2: -1,10,1000
3: -10,0,10000


-----
